# MonogameAssault

This is a demo game for learning Monogame and combining object-oriented design and data-oriented design. I also want to see how far I can come with maintainable automatic testing. Please give feedback so the community can use it.

The game involves many units on the screen, with enough CPU-bound pressure, so parallelisation is needed. This is not a massive project, but I will assume that the game should be supported for a long time and is huge, so it should be automatically testable and have "good enough" maintainability
